## Introduction

NebulaFS aims to replicate the fundamental features of IPFS while keeping the implementation straightforward and accessible. By focusing on core functionalities, this project serves as an educational tool for developers interested in decentralized storage solutions. 

## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Store and retrieve files in a distributed manner.
- **API Gateway**: Interact with the system through a RESTful API.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component operates independently, improving scalability.
- **Multiple Storage Options**: Supports MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis for data storage.
- **Message Queuing**: Utilizes RabbitMQ for efficient communication between services.
- **Built with Go**: Leverages the performance and efficiency of the Go programming language.

## Architecture

NebulaFS is built on a microservices architecture, allowing for modular development and easy scaling. The core components include:

- **API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for all client requests.
- **Storage Services**: Handles file storage and retrieval using various databases.
- **Messaging Service**: Manages inter-service communication.
- **Worker Services**: Performs background tasks like file processing.

## Getting Started

To get started with NebulaFS, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/bielsawada/nebula-fs/releases). Follow the instructions to set up and run the application.

### Prerequisites

Before running NebulaFS, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Docker (for containerized services)
- Node.js (for API Gateway if using NestJS)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bielsawada/nebula-fs.git
   cd nebula-fs
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each service. Navigate to each service folder and run:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your database. Configure your MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Redis instance as needed.

4. Start the services. Use Docker Compose for easy setup:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Running the Application

Once all services are up and running, you can interact with the API through the provided endpoints. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/bielsawada/nebula-fs/releases) for any updates or new features.

## API Documentation

NebulaFS provides a RESTful API for interacting with the storage system. Below are some key endpoints:

- **Upload File**: `POST /api/upload`
- **Retrieve File**: `GET /api/file/:id`
- **Delete File**: `DELETE /api/file/:id`

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on request parameters and response formats.

## Technologies Used

NebulaFS utilizes a variety of technologies to provide a robust solution:

- **Backend**: 
  - Go for core functionalities
  - NestJS for the API Gateway
- **Database**: 
  - MongoDB for document storage
  - PostgreSQL for relational data
  - Redis for caching
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for service communication
- **Microservices**: Each service operates independently, allowing for easy updates and scaling.
